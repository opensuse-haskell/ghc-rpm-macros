This repo is used for the latest development rpm packaging of ghc and
Haskell packages.

It is used for packaging for new versions of ghc
and as an upstream for Fedora and OpenSUSE Haskell packaging.

The aim now is to make it work across multiple ghc versions.

You probably don't want to use these macros by hand so much,
but from spec files generated by cabal-rpm or cabal2spec.
